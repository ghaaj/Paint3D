### Download from this repository

Version 2023.2310.24037.0 or earlier is recommended because later versions have [the problem that the "Open with" context menu is missing/broken](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-do-i-add-paint-3d-to-the-open-with-menu/14ad161e-a11c-4566-a4af-154f8e543ce0).
